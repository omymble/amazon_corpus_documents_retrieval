So when I saw he had a new series out I had to check it out and was not disappointed [SEP] 1) Great world creation in the House and the denizens of the House, their purpose, their origins, etc [SEP] Made for an interesting and unique setting [SEP] 2) Likeable characters that are led by the plot of the story, where options are reduced forcing the protagonists down certain routes but without the reader knowing what those results those routes will produce, per se [SEP] Kept the plot and characters engaging and fun to read [SEP] 3) Magic [SEP] Unique and fun and innovative [SEP] Loved everything about it! [SEP] 4) 98% of all storylines and subplots resolved in this single volume [SEP] Chapters had great cliff hangers and transition points to keep the reader turning and the end of the book has its own cliff hanger that makes us want to read the next book in the series though it isn't necessary [SEP] 5) As much as the storylines are resolved, the resolution was also satisfactory and didn't make me feel cheated or the author tried too hard or too little to provide a satisfying ending [SEP] THE BAD: [SEP] I don't have anything that comes to mind other than this wasn't a hugely character driven story but more plot driven and setting driven in my mind [SEP] To get more in the characters and their motivations would have been a plus but because the story focus is on the discovery of the House and things related to the House, I didn't expect to get into the characters more than we did and thus I really wasn't too disappointed [SEP] OVERALL: [SEP] I left with the feeling of having been in a fairy tale [SEP] This would make a GREAT movie in my opinion [SEP] Read Garth Nix for unique and engaging $T$ [SEP] Either read the Abhorsen Trilogy for more of an adult $T$, where the main protagonist is 17-18 yrs of age [SEP] Read this series for a protagonist that is around 12 yrs of age and the scenes are less \"dark\" than the Abhorsen trilogy [SEP] Either way, both stories are a big win",

        "text": "In this book, $T$ uses the psychoanalytic movement as a \"case study\" to explore the general human tendency to create delusional ideological systems which serve various political, social, and psychological needs [SEP] He also focuses in on the specific structural features of modern life that made psychoanalysis an especially successful ideology [SEP] As Gellner sums up in his final chapter, \"In a sense, the present book is more interested in our Zeitgeist than in psychoanalysis [SEP] The crucial strategic position occupied by Freudianism in the social and intellectual history of mankind, makes it possible for us to learn a vast amount from it about, on the one hand, the general anatomy of belief systems and, on the other, the special conditions prevalent in our age [SEP] \" [SEP] In his first two chapters, Gellner focuses in on what might be called the modern predicament [SEP] Before the rise of natural science and philosophical empiricism, it was easy to explain the mixture of good and evil, the sheer perversity, embodied in human beings [SEP] Humans were, quite literally, halfway between beasts and angels [SEP] The rise of science and modern philosophy invalidated that belief [SEP] Taking David Hume as a prime example, Gellner shows that the scientific, empiricist thought of the Enlightenment abandoned the angel/beast dichotomy [SEP] The Enlightenment theorists naturalized man: the model of man they ended up with, which Gellner dubs the \"Bundleman,\" was a random mixture of self-interested desires and needs which were easily satisfied by a conservatively cautious policy of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain [SEP] Real human beings, of course, act much more like a mixture of angel and beast than the cautiously and rationally selfish \"Bundleman\" of the Enlightenment [SEP] Nietzsche was, Gellner claims, the first serious post-Enlightenment thinker to fully realize this fact, and the realization finally drove poor Nietzsche insane [SEP] Freud's genius was to take the Nietzschean insight and domesticate it, thereby turning it into the basis of a very successful, very lucrative pseudo-scientific cult - psychoanalysis [SEP] Freud's task was made easier by certain features of the modern world [SEP] The modern world exhibits deep reverence for applied science, especially medicine [SEP] In modern industrial societies, technology has eradicated most traditional physical threats (starvation, plague, wild animals, etc [SEP] ) [SEP] In our society, the pressing threats perceived by most people lie rather in the increasing complexity of, and importance placed upon, human relationships [SEP] It is just in this area of interpersonal relationships where psychoanalysis offered help [SEP] Most of the book explores the tricks and turns by which psychoanalysis maintained its authority [SEP] Nowadays, now that there is hardly an intelligent person left who is a hard-core believer in the Freudian faith, is this of any more than historical interest? [SEP] Yes [SEP] While Freud may finally be buried, his residue endures -- as \"therapy,\" \"couselling,\" \"adjustment,\" etc [SEP] -- and continues to muddle our thinking process and our ability to make moral evaluations [SEP] As Gellner rhetorically asks, concerning the Holy Grail of \"adjustment,\" \"[I]s adaptation, adjustment to any regime, including a tyrannical one, a sign of mental health?\"  The Soviets, hardly orthodox Freudians, famously answered \"Yes!\" [SEP] But even more important, as Gellner emphasizes, the fraud of Freudianism is a typical example of the functioning of human society in general: [SEP] \"Societies possess techniques for rendering ideas socially constitutive, and these techniques tend to share certain formal features [SEP] It is important to remember that this is the normal condition of mankind: most ideas of most men at most times are beyond the reach of questioning [SEP] An idea does not have simply a cognitive role [SEP] it is at the same time linked to a set of personal relations, to loyalties, hierarchies, sentiments, hopes and fears [SEP] To shake the idea would be to disturb all that [SEP] Most men are neither willing nor able to do that [SEP] \" [SEP] To put it more bluntly, the structure of all hitherto existing human societies is grounded in socially-imposed, emotionally-compelling lies [SEP] Did Freud and his colleagues engage in bizarre intellectual contortions to prevent their ideas from being questioned or subjected to criticism? [SEP] Yes [SEP] but have you ever asked a liberal why we must slavishly accede to the results of a democratic election?  The answer is that if you choose to vote, you are obliged to accept the results, and, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain [SEP] Is Freudian reasoning any more circular than that?

This book probably read very well in the 1970s and I could even see it having some interesting points in the 1980s [SEP] But by the 1990s with the advent of AIDS better known and the options available to teens widening, books like this one began to read more as cautionary tales than as contemporary novels [SEP] I've no doubt that \"My Darling, My Hamburger\" was riveting and shocking when it first came out [SEP] Unfortunately, that's certainly no longer the case [SEP] I recommend it as a glimpse into the America that once was [SEP] If you'd like to know more about the history of the $T$, this is a good book to pick up [SEP] Just don't expect it to have too many insights to offer today [SEP] I'm afraid it's no longer that meaningful",
