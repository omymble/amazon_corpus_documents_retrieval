4 stars [SEP] The first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England [SEP] McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men [SEP] McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr [SEP] Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile [SEP] The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read [SEP] 2 [SEP] The Wire in the Blood -- 4 stars [SEP] In this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death [SEP] We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr [SEP] Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate [SEP] This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back [SEP] This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling novel than the Mermaids Singing [SEP] 3 [SEP] The Last Temptation -- 3 stars [SEP] This is the weakest book in the series [SEP] On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader [SEP] Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims [SEP] McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended [SEP] The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books [SEP] There are some serious problems with the novel, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch [SEP] First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand [SEP] The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan [SEP] The European locations never quite come to life in the same way [SEP] But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending [SEP] In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason [SEP] The whole book feels a bit contrived [SEP] Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing [SEP] 4 [SEP] The Torment of Others -- 5 stars [SEP] There's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series [SEP] By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together [SEP] In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m [SEP] o [SEP] used by a man currently in an insane asylum [SEP] How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

4 stars [SEP] The first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England [SEP] McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men [SEP] McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr [SEP] Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile [SEP] The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read [SEP] 2 [SEP] The Wire in the Blood -- 4 stars [SEP] In this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death [SEP] We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr [SEP] Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate [SEP] This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back [SEP] This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling novel than the Mermaids Singing [SEP] 3 [SEP] The Last Temptation -- 3 stars [SEP] This is the weakest book in the series [SEP] On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader [SEP] Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims [SEP] McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended [SEP] The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books [SEP] There are some serious problems with the novel, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch [SEP] First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand [SEP] The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan [SEP] The European locations never quite come to life in the same way [SEP] But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending [SEP] In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason [SEP] The whole book feels a bit contrived [SEP] Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing [SEP] 4 [SEP] The Torment of Others -- 5 stars [SEP] There's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series [SEP] By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together [SEP] In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m [SEP] o [SEP] used by a man currently in an insane asylum [SEP] How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

4 stars [SEP] The first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England [SEP] McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men [SEP] McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr [SEP] Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile [SEP] The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read [SEP] 2 [SEP] The Wire in the Blood -- 4 stars [SEP] In this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death [SEP] We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr [SEP] Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate [SEP] This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back [SEP] This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling novel than the Mermaids Singing [SEP] 3 [SEP] The Last Temptation -- 3 stars [SEP] This is the weakest book in the series [SEP] On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader [SEP] Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims [SEP] McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended [SEP] The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term $T$ with each other, are the best of any of the books [SEP] There are some serious problems with the novel, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch [SEP] First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand [SEP] The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan [SEP] The European locations never quite come to life in the same way [SEP] But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending [SEP] In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason [SEP] The whole book feels a bit contrived [SEP] Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing [SEP] 4 [SEP] The Torment of Others -- 5 stars [SEP] There's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series [SEP] By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together [SEP] In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m [SEP] o [SEP] used by a man currently in an insane asylum [SEP] How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' $T$ to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' $T$ to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

4 stars [SEP] The first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England [SEP] McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men [SEP] McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr [SEP] Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile [SEP] The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read [SEP] 2 [SEP] The Wire in the Blood -- 4 stars [SEP] In this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death [SEP] We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr [SEP] Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate [SEP] This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back [SEP] This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling $T$ than the Mermaids Singing [SEP] 3 [SEP] The Last Temptation -- 3 stars [SEP] This is the weakest book in the series [SEP] On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader [SEP] Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims [SEP] McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended [SEP] The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books [SEP] There are some serious problems with the $T$, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch [SEP] First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand [SEP] The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan [SEP] The European locations never quite come to life in the same way [SEP] But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending [SEP] In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason [SEP] The whole book feels a bit contrived [SEP] Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing [SEP] 4 [SEP] The Torment of Others -- 5 stars [SEP] There's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series [SEP] By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together [SEP] In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m [SEP] o [SEP] used by a man currently in an insane asylum [SEP] How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior $T$s and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that $T$'s events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues [SEP] There's not much to learn at this point about Dr [SEP] Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level [SEP] If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work [SEP] If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr [SEP] Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery",

Aurther is particually sensitive to this outbreak beacuse he is adopted{his birth parents died in a flu outbreak when he was a baby} [SEP] He couldn't bear to have more loved ones lost to a disease outbreak [SEP]     Then, Aurther notices a strange house that only he can see [SEP] He has a feeling that the answer to curing the sick people is to go in there [SEP] But what he finds when he does is a another world, calle the House, which was created by the Great Architect- the creator of all things [SEP]      This aerchitect left long ago, but left a will to be followed through- BUT IT WAS NOT!!! The will was broken in seven fragments, and scattered through time and space [SEP] Now the first and least fragment of the Will has escaped, and it is helping Aurther [SEP] It says that he is the rightfull heir to the kingdom{the House} but all Aurther wants is a cure to the Sleepy Plauge [SEP] The Will tells Aurther that to find this cure, he has to defeat Mister Monday, using the Minute Hand key, and claim Mondays half of the key {the Hour Hand}which will then bind with the Minute Hand to become the first and leat Key to the Kingdom [SEP] Aurther, Suzy Blue{a friend he makes on the way} and the Will now will go through many treacherous tasks to defeat Monday- the Will so that Aurther can claim the key, therefore the first part of the Will is done, Aurther to find a cure to thing strange plauge, and Suzy to help them all [SEP] I thought that this book was amazing, had great detail, and was imaginative in every way [SEP] Garth Nix did a great job, and I can't wait to read Grim Tuesday, the next book in the Keys to the Kingdom series!",
