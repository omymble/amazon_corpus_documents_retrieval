       " 'From a historical scholarly perspective, \"Why Jesus?\". I\\'ve been doing a lot of reading on early Christianity, say AD 30-200. I have learned that there were A LOT of itinerant apocalyptic type preachers in that day. Many people were referred to as \"Son of Man\". People ascribed powers to lots of wandering magicians and mystics, and \"raising people from the dead\" was not as uncommon as it seems to be today. So the question that I am looking to answer, (extra-biblically, not from a faith perspective) is, \"Why Jesus?\" Why not Appolonius of Tyana, or any of many other preacher types that proposed and preached in a similar fashion. Was it Paul\\'s zeal? James\\'? The fact that Christianity demanded monotheism and other gods didn\\'t mind if you held to previous divine allegiances?

This summer semester before I do my Limes project, I\\'m going to have another independent study class on something to do with Indo-European culture/religion and its relation to its \"daughter cultures\" (one of our ideas is doing like a comparative mythology aspect).

Here is a man whose fingerprints are all over our nation’s history, but who seems to be relegated to the role of Lincoln's antagonist. I am not a Douglas scholar by any stretch of the imagination. In fact I have not read a thing that centers on his life or his career. What I know about him I gathered from what was written about him in the books on the Civil War or Mr. Lincoln I've read. Which is a shame, such an historical figure should have a little brighter spotlight placed on him. His approach could be extremely divisive, but from what I read he was very loyal and patriotic and toward the end of the 1860 election worked incredibly hard at keeping this nation together. Now I'm not saying we should create a national holiday or anything like that. I feel (in my 21st century morality and hindsight) that many of the positions he took on the issues of the day lead us down the wrong moral and political path that brought us to the doorstep of civil war . I'm thinking maybe he and his thoughts and beliefs should be studied a bit more (even to teach us what not to do).

So, as you can probably imagine, my experiences comes from anthologies and independent research and recommendations from nice people in groups like this. This has been adequate so far, but recently I\\'ve become frustrated with the lack of opportunity I\\'ve had in becoming more serious about this, so in light of my recent transfer to a different university, I insisted that I be allowed to do an independent research project on Australian literature. I\\'ve gotten permission, and so I will be doing a sort of self-directed study on a topic of my choosing and writing a paper.

       " 'Good books on the Pacific War. Like many Americans I recently watched the first episode of HBO\\'s new history miniseries \"The Pacific\", which chronicles the history of American soldiers in the Pacific theater of World War II. Like \"Band of Brothers\" it is a beautiful well-thought production that tries to bring the viewer to the beaches and islands on which Americans fought the Japanese. However, like any historical film on war, \"The Pacific\" leaves a lot out and, in the end, is a watered down substitute that pales in comparison to a good history book. Hugh Ambrose, son of the great WWII historian Stephen Ambrose, has published a book to go along with the miniseries entitled \"The Pacific\". I wonder if there is any reason to read that book since I\\'m sure much of what is in it was already published elsewhere by people more well-connected to the events. Besides Ambrose\\'s volume, the series was based on a couple contemporary books, including Eugene Sledge\\'s \"With the Old Breed\". There are others the producers and writers used but I\\'m not sure which. Anyone know? What other books would be of interest to people watching the series? I am writing this from Shanghai, China, a country that has never forgotten the history the the war and the brutal Japanese invasion it brought (in Chinese the war is known as 抗日战争 - The War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression). In fact, just two days ago in Shanghai workers repairing one of the city\\'s busiest downtown streets uncovered a stash of WWII era bombs (without the fuses). While I don\\'t think \"The Pacific\" ventures much, if at all, into America\\'s involvement in China or other less well known venues of the Pacific War I hope people will recommend books that focus on any and all parts of the Pacific theater of war. For those interested in America\\'s presence in China during the war I highly recommend \"Stilwell and the American Experience in China\" by Barbara Tuchman. It is a very good biography about a man who was involved in nearly every aspect of America\\'s action in China during the war and years leading up to it.

I like the multiple locations, big cities all over the world. He describes places well enough that you think he knows them--although he could be quoting travel guides, lots of other writers are just too vague when describing European or Asian cities. I like that in addition to fighting the bad guys, his characters also know that if they're going to impersonate a White Hall employee, they need to smell like a mid-level bureaucrat and wear cologne by Penhaligon. (In one sentence he mentions that spying had now taken into account things such as smell--well, I had read something similar to that too in some journal about a year before); if a character is buying women's clothes, the character actually seems to know women's clothes. I can't think of the word to describe this. His characters aren't suave, they're not sophisticated, but perhaps worldly would do. Like in Krav Mag, his characters are willing and able to use anything to aide their fight and this at times might include seemingly unimportant facts. You see, I still can't put my finger on what I like about his novels. If anyone has read this far and can help me out, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Crime, Thriller & Mystery\",\n",

       " 'Suggestions for Books on Jefferson Davis. I just finished reading Jefferson Davis, American by William J. Cooper , Jr. and I was not impressed. I found the constant (and sometime long) excerpts from letter and the detailed descriptions of portraits to be boring and distracting. Reading it was like slogging through heavy, deep mud that then solidifies around you. In any event I made it the end, but I feel like I still don’t know much more about the man than I did before I read it. On the Currently Reading thread I asked about Jefferson Davis and His Generals and it was recommended along with Davis and Lee at War for more on Davis as Commander-in-Chief. However, I am hoping that there is a more readable (at least to me) biography of Jefferson Davis. I originally considered Hudson Strode ’s three volume Jefferson Davis biography, but the Boston Public Library doesn’t have the first volume and I also thought that a single volume work would take less time to read. I can get the first volume from other libraries but would like to know if it is worth reading. Are there other biographies worth reading? What about magazine or journal articles?

       " \"Buddhist Poetry. Any you recommend? Here's one by Billy Collins that I like: Shoveling Snow With Buddha In the usual iconography of the temple or the local Wok you would never see him doing such a thing, tossing the dry snow over a mountain of his bare, round shoulder, his hair tied in a knot, a model of concentration. Sitting is more his speed, if that is the word for what he does, or does not do. Even the season is wrong for him. In all his manifestations, is it not warm or slightly humid? Is this not implied by his serene expression, that smile so wide it wraps itself around the waist of the universe? But here we are, working our way down the driveway, one shovelful at a time. We toss the light powder into the clear air. We feel the cold mist on our faces. And with every heave we disappear and become lost to each other in these sudden clouds of our own making, these fountain-bursts of snow. This is so much better than a sermon in church, I say out loud, but Buddha keeps on shoveling. This is the true religion, the religion of snow, and sunlight and winter geese barking in the sky, I say, but he is too busy to hear me. He has thrown himself into shoveling snow as if it were the purpose of existence, as if the sign of a perfect life were a clear driveway you could back the car down easily and drive off into the vanities of the world with a broken heater fan and a song on the radio. All morning long we work side by side, me with my commentary and he inside his generous pocket of silence, until the hour is nearly noon and the snow is piled high all around us; then, I hear him speak. After this, he asks, can we go inside and play cards? Certainly, I reply, and I will heat some milk and bring cups of hot chocolate to the table while you shuffle the deck. and our boots stand dripping by the door. Aaah, says the Buddha, lifting his eyes and leaning for a moment on his shovel before he drives the thin blade again deep into the glittering white snow. Buddhism\",\n",
